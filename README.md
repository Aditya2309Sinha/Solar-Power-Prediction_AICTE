# Solar-Power-Prediction_AICTE
An AICTE internship project.
Here's a concise summary for a README file:

**About Project**

This project aims to develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate solar power output. By analyzing historical data (including weather, temperature, and solar radiation), the model will enhance the efficiency of solar power generation, improve energy planning and management, and support the adoption of renewable energy sources.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical solar energy production data and relevant environmental factors.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to identify key factors influencing solar power output.
4. **Model Building:** Train a linear regression model using the preprocessed data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error.
